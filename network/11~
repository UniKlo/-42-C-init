nat (10.90.1.11)

#NAT stands for "Network Address Translation.".
#It allows a single device, such as a router, to act as an agent between the Internet (or public network) and a local network (or private network), which means that only a single unique IP address is required to represent an entire group of computers to anything outside their network.
